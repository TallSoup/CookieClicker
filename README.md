# Selenium Cookie Clicker

A simple game playing automation, this was a lot of fun to build and watch.

I eventually was able to let it run for over a week, racking up billions (trillons?) of cookies.

These concepts can be applied to so many real world automations in data entry, repetitive tasks at work and more.
